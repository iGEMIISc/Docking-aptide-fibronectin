#Template‐based docking was performed by the full or interface structure alignment protocol.
#
#The scoring of the initial models was performed by the combined scoring function.

#  The result file (TBD_results.txt) contains the following parameters as a column list:
#  Contents of the columns:
#  
#  Label       --  name of the template that produced the docking model;
#  Score       --  combined score ( NOTE: all columns are sorted by this score )
#  TM-score1   --  TM-score receptor/target-receptor
#  TM-score2   --  TM-score ligand/target-ligand
#  FSC-score   --  score based on the number of shared contacts 
#  iSeqID1     --  sequence identity receptor/target-receptor
#  iSeqID2     --  sequence identity ligand/target-ligand
#  dSASA       --  difference in the values of Surface-Accessible Surface Area 
#  d_av        --  average measure of clashes in produced docking model
#  AACE18      --  interface energy calculated by the semi-empirical atom-atom contact potential
#  SolEM       --  desolvation energy
#  trgtLen1    --  length of the target receptor
#  trgtLen2    --  length of the target ligand
#  tmpltLen1   --  lenght of the template receptor
#  tmpltLen2   -- lenght of the template ligand
#  aliLen1     --  length of aligned receptor structure
